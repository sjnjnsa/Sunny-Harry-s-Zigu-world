     There was sorrow but relief too at morning mass in Milan’s Santa Maria del Rosario:
   <br>the first time that people could return to churches in 10 weeks.
   They came for comfort and to pray for Italy’s recovery.
  </p>
   <p style="margin-top:45px;">And they abided by strict measures: pews were disinfected before the service;
   <br>worshippers sat apart; and the priest wore gloves to place the communion wafer in people’s hands, not their mouths.
   <br>“It was strange to feel the body of Christ on these gloves,” said Father Marco Borghi,
   <br>“but it’s so important for people to be able to get closer to God again at this time.”
   From restaurants and bars to museums and libraries, to hair salons and beauty parlours,
   <br>Italy is reopening and emerging from the world’s longest national lockdown.</p>
